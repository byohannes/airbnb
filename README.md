# Challenge: AirBNB Project


We're going to create a simple app to view the MongoDB "sample AirBnB" data that we have.

The goal is to develop the following functionality:

1.Search for rooms by name or summary.
2.Filter by price.
and optionally

Show the top (by number of listings) superhosts in the page. On click through, show a list of their listings.

Sample front-end (client). Feel free to modify/change it if you want, or to make your own with React.

You will need to use the sample dataset sample_airbnb from MongoDB Atlas which you should already have loaded into your atlas cluster as previous homework.
